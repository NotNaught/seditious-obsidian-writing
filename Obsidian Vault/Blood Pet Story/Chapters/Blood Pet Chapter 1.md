# Chapter 1: Victims’ Services

Mia peeks over her knees at the woman at the desk, who is saying something about Mia's “rescuers”. The small plaque in front of her reads ‘Tiffany Sirenslake—Victims’ Services’. Mia glances around the room, moving only her eyes. Other than the sturdy wooden desk, there are window curtains letting in soft morning light, and a plant in the pot by the corner. There might be shelves against the side wall. Mia is balled up on a padded wooden chair. The other woman is a polished kind of pretty, like she spends a lot of time projecting exactly the look she wants others to see. Her dark curly hair just barely touches the shoulders of her thick sweater. The color of life fills the dark skin of her face, her expressions animated by the intensity of mortality. Mia wonders if she herself displays the same contrast to the eternal, perfect unlife of her family. ‘Tiffany’ is still talking, but Mia doesn't care to listen. This place is strange and unfamiliar, and Mistress isn't here. She would usually be the one to talk to outsiders. Mia's not sure what to do without her guidance.

“Greta?” Tiffany asks. Mia must have made a sound in her frustration. 

“That's not my name.”

“My dear, the other name came from a place where you were hurt quite badly, in ways you may not yet realize. I'd like you to start moving away from that, now. If Greta isn't right, is there something else we can call you?” She probably thinks she sounds comforting, kind. Like she knows best for Mia and all Mia needs to do is trust her. Mia has made the mistake of trusting people like this. The woman leans closer as she speaks, holding out a hand to Mia across the desk. Mia compresses herself against the back of the chair.

“*No*. I am Mia Vinastra, first blood pet of Clan Head Arteria Vinastra.” She says it with conviction and pride. It was a gift. She may be away from the clan and her Mistress, but she knows this. They can't take her name from her.

“Okay, okay.” Tiffany takes a breath, tries to meet Mia's evasive eyes. “We want to help you, Mia Vinastra.” The woman puts dramatic emphasis on the name, like Mia is a toddler who insists she be called ‘Sparkleflower Dreamqueen’. “We want to get you back to a normal life, after the situation you were found in. Doesn't that sound nice? Don't you want that?”

The question makes no sense. What does Mia want? What she wants hasn't mattered in so long. Not where it matters, not for her life direction. And truthfully, not for a great many other things about her life. She had been food, and that had been right. It still is. That was supposed to be forever. There could be no ‘after’. 

What does she want? She wants Mistress back. She wants the comfort of the clan, knowing her place as a trusted servant. She wants to be useful and appreciated and—if she's good—maybe gifted with The Blood before she gets old, to serve her Mistress as a handmaiden for eternity. She needs… She needs to find her way back home. This woman says she wants to help. In answer to the question, Mia shakes her head ‘no’. She can't live with humans, now she knows being a blood pet is what she's suited to, a role that fits her like a key shaped for a lock.

Tiffany watches Mia patiently, waiting for her to say something. The head shake wasn't enough, apparently. Maybe she just doesn't understand. “Can you take me back to Vinastra Manor?” She asks hopefully.

“That won't be possible, dear. The manor burned to the ground. That's why you're here. The vampires are gone and the humans have been rescued.”

Something about the explanation sparks a terrible recognition in Mia. She can't quite remember the details. She knows the truth in the woman's words, but it can't be possible. She scrabbles around in her mind to fit together the pieces, but they don't fit. How can she go back to that feeling of how things were: useful, comfortable, appreciated, loved, all her needs met? A hint of desperation enters her voice. “Maybe you could find me another clan?” It wouldn't be the same. Mistress wouldn't be there. But she understands the culture. She'll be able to serve. And maybe, after a while, she can find one of the Blood worthy to be her new mistress. 

*What*?

Mia furrows her brow and shakes her head. Where did that come from? Why would she need a new clan or mistress? She makes note of the indiscretion, to confess to Mistress when they're reunited. She will likely punish Mia, and then all will be right.

Tiffany takes advantage of Mia's confusion. “No, that would not be helpful for you in the long term. I can tell this is going to be quite a big change for you, and you're scared of what it all means. I'm going to recommend that you join a program for people like you. Everyone there is very nice and they'll understand what you're going through. They'll help you there, give you all the time you need, and when you're done, you can rejoin society.” The patronizing concern is all over her face. Mia briefly imagines Mistress slashing this woman open and draining her.

“Can I just leave instead? Go rejoin society on my own? I think I have family in Venderburg.” Mia hates lying, but she’s desperate to get back to Mistress.

“I don't think that's a good idea. In cases like yours, with supernatural mon—” she glances to the side and clears her throat. “—entities that can affect minds, we can't let you go until any influence they had has been taken care of. You'll need to stay for a bit. We'll take good care of you.” The woman smiles.

The fear that Mia hadn't noticed building saturates her blood and grips her in a vise. She can't move, can't breathe. The sloshing pump of her pulse is too loud to hear anything else. Her thoughts are locked. She needs to get back to Mistress. The thought of finding Her consumes Mia. She would use every bit of energy, every last drop of blood to find Her, but this woman here says she can't.

The Tiffany woman walks around the desk and extends her hand. “Let's get you to a place where they can help you feel better, okay?”

It's a lie. Only Mistress can make her feel better. Where *is* Mistress? 

The woman reaches forward to touch Mia's shoulder. 

Mia's conscious mind leaves, to some distant recess of thought. A remnant of Mistress is there, radiating comfort. She stays there a moment, basking in the presence of her Goddess. A pleasant memory floats by, a recent one. It envelops her. Mia is kneeling in the ritual circle in Mistress's study. A light wafting of incense fills the air. Mistress has just finished chanting words and making gestures over a small vial of her own divine Blood. She comes over. 

“Hands out, pet. Fingers pointing up.” Mia obeys immediately. 

Mistress pours a single drop on each of Mia's fingers. Slowly, each drop flows of its own accord to cover its nail, then sinks in and disappears. The last few drops go into Mia's mouth. The sensation is beyond mere taste; it's liquid bliss on her tongue. She feels the rush of magic, of her Mistress’s life force inside her, changing her to better fill her purpose. She is being rewarded for her obedience, her care, for giving herself over completely. She is consumed by the feeling for some time, then it slowly lessens to a background contentment.

“There, my pet. Now you can draw blood whenever your duties require it.” Mistress smiles at her. She has pleased Mistress. She wants to show her devotion. She looks meaningfully at her still-extended wrists, with their orderly rows of scars. Mistress gives a small nod. Her new claws look no different from before, but Mia lightly grazes one against her skin and opens up her wrist. 

“Thank You, Mistress. Thank You so much…” Mia trails off as she sinks into the feeling of flowing blood.

Mistress drinks.

She's pulled out of the memory when the large men with clubs come. Tiffany Sirenslake lies on the floor below, in a growing pool of darkening crimson. It's a shame there are no suitable vessels nearby to collect the wine of life.

The men handcuff Mia and take her to a wagon outside that looks to be a repurposed slave transport. They roughly shove her into the back, and two follow her in. The third goes up front to drive. Her cuffs are attached to the seat, between her legs. A small cushion is the only sign that they're any different from the slavers. She wonders why they bothered. 

She stares ahead, looking as blank and harmless as possible. This is not the time to attempt an escape. A trickle of warmth on her palm prompts her to loosen her grip. No point losing extra blood when she's not sure if she can spare it.

The cart bumps through city streets. Mia hears the bustling chatter of human and animal activity. The barred windows at the top of the sides of the cart are too small to see much. The guards become bored quickly when it becomes apparent she's not fighting. One takes a small book out of his pocket and mouths the words under his breath as he reads it. The other seems to be well on his way to sleep. Mia decides to meditate. She used to need Mistress to calm her mind, but she's been practicing over the past few years. Not as good as when Mistress puts her in hypnotic trance, but she needs something after the stress of the morning. She closes her eyes and slows her breathing, imagining a slowly dripping flow of red.

The texture of the ride changes gradually, from the halting pace and noise of the city, to a steadier, quieter, bumpier ride with no stops. Mia allows it all to pass through her. She notices she's still tense, realizes there's something missing from her usual meditation: the presence, the protection, the inevitability of Mistress. She's not sure how to get that feeling back. She tries to imagine meditating back in Mistress's study, adjusting her position to cross her legs around her wrists, a position She would prefer. Mia has meditated in the same position before, shackles and all. It works for a few minutes, then a branch cracks under the wheels of the cart. Suddenly Mistress's study is on fire. The flames lick up the sides of the bookcases and meander steadily across the wooden floor. It's too hot and she can't breathe. Mia doesn't know what to do, overwhelmed by the unfamiliar danger. Mistress is yelling at Mia to leave, but Mia can't. Even if she weren't restrained, she can’t just leave Her. She lets out a sound of distress and pulls at her restraints. A male voice calls out to her. She opens her eyes to see the guards alert, hands on their clubs. 

Seeing Mia shrink at the attention, the one with the book calms a bit and speaks to her for the first time. “Where we're goin’, they're s’posed to help ya with that, y’know. Be easier if you let ‘em help ya.” He shrugs and returns to his book. 

If only it were that simple.

The cart comes to a stop, and a voice outside calls out, then begins speaking with the driver. Mia must have fallen asleep at some point in the journey. She hadn’t been able to get back into meditation after the fire memory, but the stress of the morning and rocking of the cart must have taken its toll. The light outside is dimming, nearing sunset. The low howl of a gate sounds, and the cart moves forward another minute or so. When it stops again, the two guards get up and open the back doors. They disconnect her cuffs and lead her out, taking extra glances at her hands.

The cart has pulled up in front of a wide, towering brick building, with many large windows facing out onto the drive and the open greenspace on the other side. Mia has heard of the construction of new hospitals and related facilities for humans and other ‘civilized races’ as they are sometimes described. This must be one of them, nearly a day's ride from the city. The facade looks new and clean, with a large sign above the covered entrance, declaring it to be ‘Supernatural Victims’ Services — Coxley Institute for Residential Care’. The guards lead her toward this entrance, where an official-looking woman and a man wearing mage’s robes are waiting for them.

“Hello, Greta. I am Director Pinel. I am in charge of the administration of this facility. I would like to welcome you, and assure you that our goal is to keep you safe and healthy. We hope it will be a pleasant experience, even if you might not see it that way now.” She raises an eyebrow at the last part. The woman seems to honestly believe what she's saying, in the same condescending way that Tiffany did. Mia makes a note to get better at hiding her displeasure with the situation. “I understand there was some trouble in the city, so you will be starting with Dr. Franks to make sure there's no danger to anyone here.” She gestures to the wizard, who looks down at Mia with barely concealed disgust.

The man’s speech is clipped and formal. “This way please,” he makes an accompanying gesture to the guards flanking Mia. 

They pass through the front doors, and Mia gets the barest glance of a large hallway before they pass into a maze of smaller corridors, and finally into a sterile white room with a strange chair in its center. The chair looks a bit like a torture device, or one of the bleeding tables back at the Manor, with straps for each limb and the forehead. It's familiar in all the most terrifying ways, but strange enough that she's not quite sure what awaits her. The guards strap her down to the chair and leave her with the doctor and another man, who might be an assistant. Without speaking a word, they strap a mask on her face, covering her eyes, nose, and mouth. She takes a startled breath and her nose is filled with a sickly sweet flavor. A pattern moves in front of her eyes. She is quickly robbed of consciousness.
