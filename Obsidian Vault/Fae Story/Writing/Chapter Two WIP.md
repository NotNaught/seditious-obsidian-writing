She let me go.

She let me go.

She showed me the deepest, darkest recesses of my mind, twisted in a way to make me hers forever, and then she just stole my compass, gave me a doll of all things, and stopped. Fae weren't supposed to do that. I came back to my comfortable, privileged, powerful life, without a clever trick, a daring escape, a kill, or a contract. That just didn't happen.

Why did she stop? 

And why did I wish she hadn't? 

I turned my body in bed once more as I turned the thoughts in my head. It didn't feel like a strong compulsion that would have me wandering the wilds in search of her. I just felt a mild curiosity about her and how my life would change with her in it. Not to mention the other feelings that had come up from her flirtatious manner, and the ‘pain’ and ‘pleasure’ parts of her display. More prominent were the thoughts of how she had shown I didn't fit in the life of the Governor’s Son, and how much I wanted to become that vision of the Adventuring Girl %% rethink name? %%. The feelings had been present before, of course, looming just out of sight, but that night's display had brought them into focus in the clear light of a new sunrise. I already ached to take action, to end any possibility of becoming Him and move toward being Her.

I should have burned the doll in the wilds and gone immediately to the church instead of home. That's what I'd been taught to do about Fae encounters. I'd done it before. %% Not sure if I want to establish this %% But I couldn't. It somehow felt like that would be a betrayal to myself, forcing myself onto the life path I now hated more than ever. Was that part of Fae corruption? Did I have a compulsion to keep her doll, so that it could further manipulate me? I couldn't let anyone else know I'd gone out, so how could I be sure I was free of mental influence? 

Of course! Quarantine. Citizens who were suspected of Fae corruption would be monitored and restricted to essential activities for ten days after exposure. I could modify the protocols and monitor myself. %% Hmmm is this silly? Maybe instead she gets caught and quarantined in secret—more characterization for Dad? More brainstorming in outline %%
