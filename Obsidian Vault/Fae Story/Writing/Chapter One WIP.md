“Ha! Chaos! A bit of a narrow view. You don't even understand what you're asking, do you, little… princess?” She enunciated the word slowly, sucking out the meaning, like marrow from a bone. I felt a faint tug behind my sternum, like she had a hook in my soul. 

Did she know? Was she just testing for a reaction? Did it even matter, with a creature like this?

“Fae magic, my little morsel, is the essence of difference.” She licked a long, lithe tongue over a mouth full of sharp teeth. I needed to run, but a very small voice said to go closer. “Contrast, conflict, contradiction. Harmony, opposition, negation, creation. Change across boundaries and outside them altogether. A paradox unresolved, ever changing in conflict and harmony with itself.” I was sweating, entranced by her sensuous, slinking, deadly movements. The clearing had changed subtly. Where was the path?

“Kindness and cruelty. Change and stagnation. Trust and betrayal. Truth and lies and in-between. Life and death and both at once. Freedom. Confinement. Slavery. Authority. Obligation.

“Man.” In an instant, he was a man, a mirror of me, but with Fae features: a longer face, pointed ears, vertically slitted eyes in her forest green color, flecked with shining gold. A neatly trimmed beard rode his—my—chin, head angled high in the haughty pose of the Governor's Son and successor. A sharp, blue and gold officer's uniform, with a rifle slung over his shoulder and cold-iron-edged rapier at the hip completed the look of one who held power without thought, seizing more for the sake of simply having it. His gaze found mine, a haughty glare projecting total confidence that I would be quickly brought under heel or destroyed, and he didn't much care which.

The sight made me nauseous. I wanted to rip him to pieces with my bare hands and destroy everything that made him possible. I had never felt this angry before. The feeling that filled every corner of my mind was beyond hatred, possibly beyond the entire purview of emotion. At the basest level, I knew, with a certainty never felt before, that this man's existence was anathema to my own. I required that he be annihilated. But before I could finish the thought, before I could begin to take action, the Fae changed again.

“Woman.” A face like the man, but feminine, like a Fae transformation of the sister I didn't have, or like the pictures of my mother when she was young. She sat in a rocking chair, facing another woman whose hair and dress barely peeked out from behind a nearby tree. I—and I somehow, intuitively, knew this countenance was me—wore a dark blue evening dress with sections of beautifully embroidered creatures in woodland, and deftly worked with colorful thread, embroidering a yellow garment in her (my?) lap. She spoke to her friend as she worked, and underneath the yellow I spied a bump at her waist; she was pregnant.

I felt an intense longing toward this display. It flew in the face of all I had been taught: I must be a man, must be strong and protective, not just for my wife and family, but for the entire city-state which would one day rest on my shoulders. Confronted with an exhibition of myself, as a domestic, submissive woman, whose domain lay only in the house, the family, and a few proper, acceptable friends, I wondered: Is it even possible? Could Fae magic give me this life, or was it just a trick, a charade built from my most indulgent fantasies? Moving further, I found myself thinking something I'd never had a chance to: If it were possible, would I even want it? I would gladly ditch the crushing pressure of expectation and the horror of my repulsively male anatomy. I could do without the loneliness of being different, but was it the difference that was the problem, or the loneliness from people and a place that didn't know or understand or accept me?

As I stared, lost in my thoughts, the Fae-woman-me met my gaze. She smiled, an expression that was all warmth and kindness in the mouth, concealing a familiar grimace in those pine-and-gold eyes. She had a different set of rules and expectations, no less heavy than those of the Governor's Son. She had none of the excitement I needed, no ill-advised trips into the deadly wilds for her. She had to hide her difference, or cease being a version of me altogether. After a long moment that felt like carefully, methodically ripping out a part of myself, I slowly shook my head, and the fantasy was gone.

She replaced it with a vision of even better.

“Someone… More?” She echoed from all around me, in a deeper but still feminine voice, tone dripping with flirtatious satisfaction. She had transformed again. The face was almost the same as the previous— still just as feminine, but slightly leaner, absent the effects of wealth and pregnancy. She sighted through the trees, displaying curiosity, confidence, and a desire to explore. She had a similar hat to the ridiculous tricorne of the Governor's Son, but crumpled and worn, with the gold trim ripped off and the blue dyed to a dark brown. A red bird in flight was painted on the side.

“Pain.” She stabbed a sword through my chest, directly through my heart. A dozen other blades pierced my throat, chest, abdomen, thighs, hands, and feet. Sharp, wet, unbearable heat pulsed with each wet sputter of my dying heart. Every muscle cramped, pulling and twisting my skeleton to breaking. After a moment, every surface of my skin began to burn in glacial agony. My skull strained under the pressure of a million meteor impacts. In that eternity of an instant, it was impossible to exist as a coherent being, let alone think or form memories. It simply continued until finally, blissfully, it all stopped.

I was intact, uninjured. The pain had simply stopped, with no lingering. The Faerie stood before me, nearly nude, eyebrow cocked, with a predatory smirk. Reeling, I took a single breath, in and out. Some inexplicable urge possessed me to return her smile with a small, exhausted one of my own. She continued.

“Pleasure.” She was touching me all over, with a thousand hands, a thousand tongues, a thousand bodies pressed against mine. Lazy comfort and safety built slowly to full-body shivers, then continued to the familiar build up of an orgasm, but all over my body, rather than just the organ I was used to. I built up to the climax, but instead of a short splash that usually faded quickly, the tide of bliss rose and rose and filled my being. I was still being touched but could recognize little else. Discomfort built at the enormity of the feeling, even as I craved more. This continued for what felt like hours, until it all stopped suddenly. As my mind crashed back to earth, the Fae girl licked her lips before me.

“Sensation.” A short pause, then: I was being touched, licked, kissed, eaten, slashed, cuddled, whipped, frozen, stroked, scratched, burned, beheaded, massaged, and pleasured. Each sensation followed in turn, to be experienced separately and yet all at once. I saw a rapid swirl of every color and some that don't exist. I smelled every delicious spice and every deadly gas. I tasted delicious meals, worms, lye, sweets, mercury, rain, and gunpowder. I heard every word, every creature, every screech, call, song, growl, and every type of silence. Every possible feeling, the sensory span of the universe, was compressed into that single second. %% Todo: more? %%

“Deprivation.” Her voice took on a huskiness

“Sooooo, do ya get it now?” It took me a moment to get my senses back in order. We were in the same place, the Fae girl sounded chipper, leaning forward with her hands clasped behind her back, head tilted to one side. “Hmmm, maybe that was a bit too much. Not broken. You're pretty tough for a human. Hope you enjoyed it! Seemed like you did. Kinda, sorta. Enough…” She trailed off.

I had fallen to my knees. My gaze fell to the ground as I tried and failed to make sense of the past few—what?—minutes? Millennia? My eyes focused on my pack, just a few feet away on the ground. A reminder that I couldn't stay out here, piecing myself back together. I needed to escape back to the city.

The girl followed my gaze. “Oh yeah! We should make a trade so we can stay in contact. Wouldn't want you to come back looking for me and run into my brothers. Or my uncle. Or most of my family, honestly. Here!” She hopped over to my pack and started rummaging, holding up \[my compass | my copy of \<book>]. “This means a lot to you, right? Is it ok if I borrow it, and lend you my Sally?” She held up a doll made of sticks, leaves, and hand-woven fabric. 

My defenses battered down, I couldn't help but weakly nod assent to the pretty girl who showed interest in me. With what she'd just shown she could do, my life was probably forfeit anyway.

“Okaaaaay! See ya later, princess!” She flounced off into the forest, turning around one more time to give a big wave and blow me a kiss, before she disappeared behind the tree trunks.

For a moment, I was too shocked to do anything, but training took over, identified this as my opportunity to get the hells out. Before my conscious mind caught up, I was on my feet, grabbing my pack, and pounding dirt away from that place, in my best guess of the direction to home.
