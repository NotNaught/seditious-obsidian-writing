![[The City-State of Valonia#^ValoniaVsLeague]]

[[The Valonian Empire]] is a collection of walled city-states, mostly along the coast, who use guns, stone magic, and large naval ships. In the past few decades, the seas have gotten more treacherous, so land-based caravans and more recently, [[Railroads]], have been favored for transporting people and goods throughout the empire.
