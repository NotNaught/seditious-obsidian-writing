#StoneShard
> Some stories say, a long, long time ago, there was a third moon, made of glowing, glittering crystal. Some grand event lost to our history caused the entire mass to shatter, raining shards to the earth for hundreds of years. Large chunks buried themselves deep beneath the ground, settling in and seeping their energies through the land. Sometimes they created grand, twisting caves, scintillating with shards of divinity. Others mixed with minerals and created strange rock formations and creatures to protect them. Still others may have buried themselves so deep that mortals will never find them.

Stone magic is really good for artifice, and can be used for simple effects in wands and staves. More complex machines can also be built with various techniques to manipulate the magical energies.

Those who spend time working with shards and stone magic will slowly turn to living stone. This can cause severe health problems if not ameliorated with even more shards to stabilize the process. Protections exist in the form of clothing, respirators, and potions, though these are often not available to miners.
