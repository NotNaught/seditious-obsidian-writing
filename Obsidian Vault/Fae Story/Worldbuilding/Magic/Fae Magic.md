#Fae
- Humans will also call this “chaos magic” because of its varied and often unpredictable effects. 
- Human efforts to harness or control this magic have almost all resulted in disaster. 
- It is rumored that the magic itself is alive and quite opinionated (true-ish). 
- Interacts with thoughts and meaning in a way that other magic simply doesn't. Other magic doesn't care about truth, secrets, culture, contracts, social interactions, or relationships, but Fae magic certainly does.
- Fae creatures are the only ones who seem to be able to reliably use this magic to their own ends. 
## Faetouched (Faetochen?)
Not much is known by mortals about the Faetouched. Most who would fall into this category remain in the Fae realms or bordering areas, where they would not have contact with the majority of human/railroad society.
## Changelings
Like Faetouched in reverse — Fae creatures who have chosen to try a human life. They appear normal and human (and don't even remember being Fae beyond occasional dreams) until they die or encounter a trigger (usually something Fae in nature) to activate their true nature. They may have strange interests, abilities
## Names and Meanings
Names are incredibly important to Fae, because they're words that point to identity. They give power to describe, connect with, and define a person. Most Fae will accumulate a large collection of names for themselves, to better self-define in the chaotic Fae Realm and to protect themselves against being fully defined/controlled/understood by another.
