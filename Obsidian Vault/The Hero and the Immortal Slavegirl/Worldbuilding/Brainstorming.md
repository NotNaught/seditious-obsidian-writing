# Story Mechanics
- 3rd person omniscient? 
- Focus on the relationship and stories, skip epic adventure and battles
# Characters
- Jaina (Hero From Another World)
	- Magic and whips (not subtle lol)
	- trans girl who did not
	- latent sadist
	- bought a storytelling slave to learn more about the world as she adventures
	- thinks that she will treat her slave well and free her
- Berylen (Slave)
	- Cursed by the goddess of life (change, strife, etc) to live forever
	- has lived for thousands, even tens of thousands of years
	- eternal life with no other special abilities means that she gets the attention of powerful people and has very little ability to do anything about that
	- in most ages, she ends up being a slave of a series of powerful people or families
	- over the ages, she has found purpose in service and being treated as inhuman property, it is part of her identity and how she feels fulfilled

# World
## Ages
World goes through Ages of ~100-1000 years, where certain aspects of magic and certain gods are enhanced, more powerful.

Current Age: Age of Heroes

Isekai: standard one/a few related heroes from another world? 
OR
Video game MMO with system %% system AND important deities probably too much unless they're tied together - god of nerdy stats %%
OR
Gacha-style: many heroes, lower ranked ones basically just wander around and do stuff
