Listen close, all! For I have a grand story to tell you tonight! This tale comes to us from Porseria, a world far, far away from where we sit now, but I assure you that it is a real place, and my words to come are truer than you might expect. 

Porseria is a world of magic, where energies tied to all manner of things slosh and mix, rise and fall like water in a washbasin. A very large, slow-moving one, though. Perhaps a washbasin for Titans, filled with molasses. Anyway, Gods and Goddesses ride these waves and channel their powers into Ages for the mortals and creatures of Porseria. Or story takes place in an Age of Heroes, and begins with the meeting of two women who were touched by Goddesses.
