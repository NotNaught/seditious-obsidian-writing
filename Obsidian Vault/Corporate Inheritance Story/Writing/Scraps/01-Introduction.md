Life on a lesbian pirate ship isn't exactly what Kelli expected. Sure, there's a lot of women fucking, but it's not at all what the pornsims would have you believe: mostly in pairs and (almost) always in private. Sure, itâ€™d been easy to get a girlfriend, two even, but relationships progress just as slowly and awkwardly as they had stationside. But the main thing she loves, that she'd had no way to expect, is the ease of social interaction. Almost half the crew is other trans women  even, which really cuts into her ability to feel fake and out of place, too.
