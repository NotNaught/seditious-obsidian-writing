“Do you know how my parents found out that I'm… like this?” Nyla asks. 

“Trans?” Kelli asks.

“But am I really?”

“Yes. You might not have the same experiences as a lot of us, but you're still trans, right? Born with a penis, raised as a boy?” Kelli's eyebrows knit together. She didn't think the brainworms would be this bad. 

“That's kind of my point, though.” Nyla points a finger at Kelli. “How do you think my parents found out?”

“I don't know, either you told them or they found some sign, like clothes or writing or—”

“Nope! I wish! They found out from a medical test in utero.” Nyla laughs uncomfortably.

“What?”

The girl's expression grows manic as she explains. “Yeah, they test embryos for all sorts of diseases and conditions, and apparently I was ‘eighty percent likely’ to be trans! So I was raised with that knowledge hanging over me, like it had to be resolved and then fixed! Honestly,” she calms herself a little, and drops to a conspiratorial tone, “I think they were relieved when I was ten and told them I wanted to be a girl full-time.”

“Wow.” Kelli takes a moment to think through this revelation. “So, you were raised as a girl?”

“After ten, yeah. But before then... So, there was the eighty percent, right? And we know how that turned out.” She makes a sweep with her hands, demonstrating her unmistakably feminine body. Kelli's eyes can't help but linger a moment on her thighs in the tight dress. “But my family couldn't risk giving dysphoria to that valuable twenty-percent-son in me.” Nyla rolls her eyes. “They gave me choices. Options. Dolls or spaceships. Cooking or building. Play with boys or girls. That sort of thing.”

“Seems weirdly gender-essentialist for being so supportive of you being trans.”

“I wouldn't really say ‘supportive’,” she looks up in the air, thinking it through. “They knew about how bad dysphoria can be, and they controlled everything around me to make sure it didn't happen. It's like there was a mystery to solve, and my brain and body were places of interest. If they could only find the evidence pointing to ‘girl’ or ‘boy’, maybe they could figure out how to start treating me like a person.” She chuckles softly, “I messed up their plans for a while by being a bit of a tomboy. They weren't sure what to do when I was interested in sports and technology and clothes, but not business. I think they were terrified I wouldn't be a boy or a girl.” %%insert Kelli being super gay%%

“Your parents sound so weird to me,” Kelli says, eliciting a shrug and another conspiratorial eye roll. “You, at least, know it's normal, right? A third of the crew back on the *Sappho* are some flavor of nonbinary. ”

“Yeah, I know. I even dated one for about a year.”

“I'm sure your family loved them.”

Nyla’s lips form a confident smirk. “We didn't really care.”

How is this the same girl who was quietly watching in the corner?

“If your whole family's like that, how are you… so much cooler?” Kelli asks. 

“Well, I didn't make many friends as the kid whose parents would jump on anyone misgendering me, especially after my dad got that teacher fired for making me cry. So I used my tech curiosity and found my way into some public networks. Plenty of trans people out there for me to read and watch about, find a bit of connection.” Nyla said.

“I take it you didn't participate, though?”

Nyla looks down at her glass. “Didn't feel like I was really part of the group. Didn't really get much dysphoria as a kid, and any I did have was resolved when I got 'the perfect transition' as a teenager. Plus secrecy, I guess. My parents could find out if I posted anything.”

Kelli gives a little huff of amusement—much cuter in this body, she notices—and places a hand on Nyla's shoulder. “Girl, there's nothing more like a trans woman than trying to find a reason you're not a trans woman. Your life's been hard in weird ways, yeah, but you're still one of us." She touches Nyla's hand and looks into her beautiful dark brown eyes. "And you're pretty, too.”
