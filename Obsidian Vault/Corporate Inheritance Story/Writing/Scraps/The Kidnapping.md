Kelli's doorbell rings four times, yanking her toward consciousness but only getting her halfway there. She makes an attempt to sit and grab her sidearm from the nightstand, but instead flops over, misses her handhold, and crashes into a new resting place on her floor. She's almost decided to go back to sleep there when the ringing starts again: five times, accompanied by knocking on her apartment door. Not slamming—this knocking is firm and insistent, but still polite. Strange. She checks the time. 0600 hours. 

Probably not kids, then. As she slowly pulls herself off the floor She runs through her memory for anything that would have made her landlord upset and comes up with nothing. Rent was wired and confirmed last week. Better check anyway. Maybe someone she knows is in trouble. She puts on some sweatpants and tucks her gun into the back of the waistband before opening the door. 

The man standing there, holding an infotab and stylus, is short. He looks like some kind of professional who's never worked with his hands. Definitely not here to intimidate her, then. At least, not physically. %%rewrite section before%% He's wearing a crisp, spotless corporate-style suit. How it and his gently coiffed hair remained untouched getting to this part of the station is beyond Kelli; maybe it's got some fancy tech stuff in it. Something about the man's facial features brings to mind a guinea pig, though (thankfully) without the whiskers.

"You must have the wrong place..." She's almost shut the door on him when he puts the infotab in the space to block it. 

"Kelli Warren?" It's just barely a question. Kelli can see her name and picture on the tab, along with her birthday, height, mass, blood type, and a lot of other tiny writing she can't make out behind the door. It's an expensive device model. She'd hate to break it, but that amount of information is *dangerous*.

"Who's asking?" She asks, still pressing the door closed.

"Daniel Stillwater, attorney. Miss Warren, I'm representing the Galeron family in a particular matter, and—"

"You gonna pay me? Because otherwise, I don't know anything." Kelli has no love for the megacorps that vie for control far away from her business (hopefully far away, at least). She has a special distaste for Galeron Corp, which once tied up two whole months of paychecks in a mire of bureaucracy that took *three* months to clear.

"Miss Warren, it's not about what you know, but who you may be. Believe me, you have much to gain if this goes well. Now please, if we could just confirm a few things..." That's the second time he's called her "Miss", despite her face, voice, stature, everything. He must *really* want something here.

Kelli opens the door just enough to stick out her hand, rubbing her fingers in the universal sign for "give me money."

Immediately, she sees a notification in the corner of her vision—a no-strings instatransfer of fifty *thousand* Decis straight into her account from "Galeron Legacy Entitlements". That's more than a month's pay on the *Lady Dove*. Kelli cautiously opens the door. If she has this much of the corpos' attention, it's probably best to cooperate while she still has a choice.

"What do you want, then?" She asks, crossing her arms in the doorway. 

"It's a matter of establishing parentage and inheritance. Your mother was Eletta Warren?"

*Fuck.* "My father worked for Galeron. You here to pass on his debts?" Not much room to escape if he is. She glances out the door to see a large man at either end of the hallway. *Fuck fuck shit!*

The lawyer notices her panic. "They're here for your protection as well as mine. Could we take this inside, for privacy?"

Why not? She's already screwed if they want her to be. Might as well be comfortable until then. "Okay," She squeaks out, "Please, uh, come in..." %%%%

Kelli gestures Mr. Stillwater over to her well-worn sofa and rolls over her desk chair to sit across from him, closer to the middle of the room with more routes for escape. She briefly wonders if she could survive a jump out the windows, before remembering that they're simulated. Too many action sims and too much adrenaline.

Mr. Stillwater continues the conversation. "To answer your question about debts, the answer is: Not exactly. I have some documents for you to read and sign. Those should explain everything." He holds out a second infotab and a stylus. Kelli takes it and feels a sharp, painful pinch from where her finger first came into contact with the stylus. 

"What the fuck! Your tech fucking *bit me!*" She sucks a small drop of blood off of her finger.

Daniel Stillwater ignores this and looks at something in his own infotab. "As I expected. Congratulations, Miss Warren, you are now acknowledged as the firstborn child of Willett Galeron, CEO of Galeron Interplanetary Enterprises."

At first the words don't mean anything. Her thoughts were on a smooth (if panicked) vector toward eternal debt and corporate slavery. Now they have to do a hard burn toward the abjectly impossible. She's suddenly dizzy, staggers back a step to steady herself. It must be a prank or a scam or something. But he already sent her a *ton* of money from a Galeron account, just like that. But it can't be *real*. This kind of thing just doesn't happen to people. Especially not to people *like Kelli*. Plus, it would mean that her deadbeat corpo father, who abandoned Kelli's mother before Kelli was even born, is *important*. Not just important, but one of the richest men in the galaxy. 

The lawyer is still sitting there, attempting to sit up straight and dignified on her lumpy, sunken couch, waiting patiently and dispassionately for her to process. He looks almost bored, like he's suffering through the part of his job where he waits for someone important to acknowledge him. He's probably being paid obscene amounts of money by the minute to be here. As he continues to stare, she realizes *she's* the important person he's waiting on. The thought makes her profoundly uncomfortable.

"I—Umm. Wh—" She can't get the thoughts together into words. "If... If that's true, then why didn't I know already?"

"Hmmm, how do I put this? It was assumed that a child of Willett Galeron and the woman you know as Eletta Warren, if one existed, would be... illegitimate."

"You thought I was a bastard. Okay, that kind of makes sense. What changed?"

"Frankly, they thought it was settled. Your mother tried to keep you hidden, and no one cared to poke into it and rouse a new heir. But then Willett took ill. I suppose that changed his mind. He assigned me to look into the matter, and here's what I found: Your parents were married in secret. Mr. Galeron's father got the marriage annulled, but... well, to quote an absolutely ancient ruling, 'A union that produces a child cannot be annulled.' Effectively, it's treated as a kind of divorce."

"Which makes Eletta's tranny dyke daughter suddenly legitimate." *Fuuuck*. Kelli's current life isn't over in the boring way, but in a much more exciting way. "A bunch of powerful people probably want me dead now, don't they?"

"That seems likely, once they find out, yes." The lawyer runs a hand through his hair. It returns to *exactly* the same arrangement it had before. "Your father has made every effort to keep the information to as few people as possible, but the information will get out eventually. It will probably be sooner, now I've contacted you."

Mr Stillwater glances down at his tab and taps out a message. "We should get you to safety, Miss Warren. You'll find a number of documents on that infotab you're holding, which generally amount to you accepting your position in the family and company, and ensuring your continued health and safety. As soon as you sign all those, we will move you to a secure location." %% edit to be more manipulative? %%

"Can I at least let my girlfriends know where I'll be?" Kelli asks.

"That would not be wise."

"Will I have a way to contact them?"
